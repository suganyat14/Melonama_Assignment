# Melonama Detection Assignment
> Melonama Cancer Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Project needs to follow the below requirements:
Project pipeline as described
Rescale the images to normalize pixel values between (0,1)
Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~20 epochs
Choose an appropriate data augmentation strategy
Class distribution: Examine the current class distribution in the training dataset
Which class has the least number of samples?
Which classes dominate the data in terms of the proportionate number of samples?
Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.
NOTE:
You don't have to use any pre-trained model using Transfer learning. All the model building processes should be based on a custom model.


## Conclusions
- Class imbalance improves the accuracy
- Data Augumentation is needed
- Data normalization is required
- Optimizer and loss function improves the accuracy


## Technologies Used
- Keras 2.8.0
